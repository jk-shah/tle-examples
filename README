This repo shows examples of developing PostgreSQL extensions along with making them useful with 
Trusted Language Extensions ( https://github.com/aws/pg_tle )
The assumption is the target database has created the pg_tle extension and 
the user has been granted the pgtle_admin role which allows  them to create the extensions.

This repo intents to help learn about developing extensions for PostgreSQL universally and hence 
it attempts to provide examples keeping the same look and feel of PostgreSQL extensions typically
developed in C language.

The main logic is stored in pgtle.mk file which is designed to be activated using
USE_PGTLE=1 and helps to install, test the extension and also uninstall the extension using pg_tle.

Also to enable building it remotely copy the env.ini to env in the same directory and 
modify locations to your setup

Examples of usage:

Install using `make USE_PGTLE=1 install' to install to a target PostgreSQL database with pg_tle activated.

This repo consists of demo extensions to help developers to clone and start their own extensions rapidly also.
